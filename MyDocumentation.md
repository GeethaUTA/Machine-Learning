* Warren 
McCulloch and Walter Pitts published the first concept of a simplified brain cell, 
the so-called McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neuron, in 1943
* McCulloch and Pitts described such a nerve cell as a simple logic gate with binary 
outputs; multiple signals arrive at the dendrites, they are then integrated into the cell 
body, and, if the accumulated signal exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is 
generated that will be passed on by the axon
