* Warren 
McCulloch and Walter Pitts published the first concept of a simplified brain cell, 
the so-called McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neuron, in 1943
* McCulloch and Pitts described such a nerve cell as a simple logic gate with binary 
outputs; multiple signals arrive at the dendrites, they are then integrated into the cell 
body, and, if the accumulated signal exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is 
generated that will be passed on by the axon
* Only a few years later, Frank Rosenblatt published the first concept of the perceptron 
learning rule based on the MCP neuron mode
* With his 
perceptron rule, Rosenblatt proposed an algorithm that would automatically learn 
the optimal weight coefficients that would then be multiplied with the input features 
in order to make the decision of whether a neuron fires (transmits a signal) or not.
* More formally, we can put the idea behind artificial neurons into the context of 
a binary classification task where we refer to our two classes as 1 (positive class) and 
–1 (negative class) for simplicity. We can then define a decision function (𝜙𝜙(𝑧𝑧)) that 
takes a linear combination of certain input values, x, and a corresponding weight 
vector, w, where z is the so-called net input
